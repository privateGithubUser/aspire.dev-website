## Name

`aspire doctor` - Check the Aspire development environment for common issues.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire doctor [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire doctor` command runs a series of diagnostic checks to verify that your development environment is properly configured for Aspire development. It checks prerequisites such as the .NET SDK, container runtime, and environment settings.

This command is useful for troubleshooting when you encounter issues with Aspire or when setting up a new development environment. The checks are grouped by category:

- **SDK checks**: Verifies .NET SDK installation and version requirements
- **Container checks**: Validates container runtime (Docker/Podman) availability and configuration
- **Environment checks**: Validates environment variables and other settings

The command displays results with clear status indicators:

- ✓ (green) - Check passed
- ⚠ (yellow) - Warning (non-blocking issue)
- ✗ (red) - Check failed (blocking issue)

If any checks fail, the command provides suggestions for how to fix the issues and links to relevant documentation.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--json`**

  Outputs the check results in JSON format. This is useful for automation scenarios or when you need to parse the results programmatically.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-help.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-debug.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-wait.md" />

## Examples

- Run diagnostic checks on your development environment:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire doctor
  ```

- Run diagnostic checks with JSON output:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire doctor --json
  ```
