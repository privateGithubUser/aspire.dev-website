Aspire provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool to help you create and manage Aspire-based apps. The CLI streamlines your development workflow with an interactive-first experience. This guide shows you how to install the Aspire CLI on your system. The Aspire CLI requires the [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0).

Before installing the Aspire CLI, ensure you have the [required prerequisites](/get-started/prerequisites/) set up.

## Install as a native executable

The Aspire CLI is installed using an installation script available for Bash and PowerShell.

<Aside type="note" title="Download and install" icon="download">
You can download and run the script in a single command, to install the Aspire CLI as a native executable:

<Tabs syncKey="terminal">
    <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
        <Code
            lang="bash"
            code="curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh | bash"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
        <Code
            lang="powershell"
            code='iex "& { $(irm https://aspire.dev/install.ps1) }"'
        />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The script installs the latest stable release of Aspire CLI. See [Validation](#validation) to verify the installation.
</Aside>

Alternatively, you can download the script and run it as a two-step process:

<Steps>
01. Open a terminal.
01. Download the script and save it as a file:

    <Tabs syncKey="terminal">
        <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
            <Code
                lang="bash"
                code="curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh -o aspire-install.sh"
            />
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
            <Code
                lang="powershell"
                code='irm https://aspire.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile aspire-install.ps1'
            />
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

01. Run the script to install the stable release build of Aspire.

    You should see output similar to the following snippet:

    <Tabs syncKey="terminal">
        <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
            ```txt title="Output" frame="terminal"
            Downloading from: https://aka.ms/dotnet/9/aspire/ga/daily/aspire-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz
            Aspire CLI successfully installed to: /home/username/.aspire/bin/aspire
            Added /home/username/.aspire/bin to PATH for current session
            Added /home/username/.aspire/bin to PATH in /home/username/.bashrc
            
            The aspire cli is now available for use in this and new sessions.
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
            ```txt title="Output" frame="terminal"
            Downloading from: https://aka.ms/dotnet/9/aspire/ga/daily/aspire-cli-win-x64.zip
            Aspire CLI successfully installed to: C:\Users\name\.aspire\bin\aspire.exe
            Added C:\Users\username\.aspire\bin to PATH for current session
            Added C:\Users\username\.aspire\bin to user PATH environment variable
            
            The aspire cli is now available for use in this and new sessions.
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
</Steps>

## Install as a .NET global tool

Use the `dotnet tool` command to install the Aspire CLI global tool. The name of the global tool is [`Aspire.Cli`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.CLI).

<Steps>
01. Open a terminal.
01. Run the following command to install Aspire CLI:

    ```bash title=".NET CLI"
    dotnet tool install -g Aspire.Cli
    ```

    <Aside type="tip" title="Not recommended" icon="random">
        Although the .NET global tool installation method is functional, we recommend using the native executable installation script for the best experience.
    </Aside>
</Steps>

## Validation

To validate that the global tool is installed, use `aspire --version` to query Aspire CLI for a version number:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire --version
```

Consider the following example of running the command:

<AsciinemaPlayer
    src="/casts/aspire-version.cast"
    poster="npt:0:01"
    rows="5"
    autoPlay={true}
/>

If that command works, you're presented with the version of the Aspire CLI tool:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Output"
13.0.0+{commitSHA}
```

The `+{commitSHA}` suffix indicates the specific commit from which the Aspire CLI was built. This suffix is included in pre-release builds and may not be present in stable releases.

<Aside type='caution' title='Troubleshooting'>
If you're not seeing a version number, it's possible that your terminal session needs to be restarted to pick up the changes to your PATH environment variable. Simply close and reopen your terminal, then try running the `aspire --version` command again.
