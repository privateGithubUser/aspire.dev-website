<h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Come meet the new Aspire</h2>

<div style="max-width: 100%;">

Discover Aspire and learn how it can transform the way you build and deploy your distributed apps and agents. With code-centric control, orchestrate and observe simple or complex systems with no rewrites, and deploy anywhere. Come meet the new Aspire.

We'll have sessions for everyone and every skill level. All developers welcome no matter what languages, frameworks, compute environments, clouds, or coding agents you use. See how Aspire provides the primitives that make AI-assisted development practical and fun.

Streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j61K9Sna2M">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aspiredotdev">Twitch</a>, ask questions and interact with us live. We hope to see you there!

**Stay tuned for the full agenda.**
