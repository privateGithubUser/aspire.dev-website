The [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview/) provides a great UI for viewing telemetry. The dashboard:

- Ships as a container image that can be used with any OpenTelemetry enabled app.
- Can be used standalone, without the rest of Aspire.

## Start the dashboard

The dashboard is started using the Docker command line.

<OsAwareTabs syncKey="terminal">
<div slot="unix">

```bash
docker run --rm -it -d \
    -p 18888:18888 \
    -p 4317:18889 \
    --name aspire-dashboard \
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:latest
```

</div>
<div slot="windows">

```powershell
docker run --rm -it -d `
    -p 18888:18888 `
    -p 4317:18889 `
    --name aspire-dashboard `
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:latest
```

</div>
</OsAwareTabs>

The preceding Docker command:

- Starts a container from the `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:latest` image.
- The container exposes two ports:
  - Mapping the dashboard's OTLP port `18889` to the host's port `4317`. Port `4317` receives OpenTelemetry data from apps. Apps send data using [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/).
  - Mapping the dashboard's port `18888` to the host's port `18888`. Port `18888` has the dashboard UI. Navigate to `http://localhost:18888` in the browser to view the dashboard.

## Login to the dashboard

Data displayed in the dashboard can be sensitive. By default, the dashboard is secured with authentication that requires a token to login.

When the dashboard is run from a standalone container, the login token is printed to the container logs. The logs are displayed in the Docker Desktop user interface on the **Logs** tab for the **aspire-dashboard** container:

<Image src={containerLogImage} alt="Screenshot of the Aspire dashboard container logs." />

After copying the highlighted token into the login page, select the *Login* button.

Alternatively, you can obtain the token from the logs by using the `docker` command:

<OsAwareTabs syncKey="terminal">
<div slot="unix">

```bash frame="terminal"
#!/bin/bash
loginLine=$(docker container logs aspire-dashboard | grep "login?t=")
match=$(echo "$loginLine" | sed -n 's/.*login?t=\([^[:space:]]*\).*/\1/p')
echo -n "$match" | xclip -selection clipboard
echo "$match"
```

<Aside type="tip">
This script requires that your system has the `sed` and `xclip` tools installed.
</Aside>

</div>
<div slot="windows">

```powershell
$loginLine =  docker container logs aspire-dashboard | Select-String "login\?t="
$matches = [regex]::Match($loginLine, "(?<=login\?t=)(\S+)")
$matches.Value | Set-Clipboard
echo $matches.Value
```

</div>
</OsAwareTabs>

<Aside type="tip">
To avoid the login, you can disable the authentication requirement by setting the `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS` environment variable to `true`. Additional configuration is available, see [Dashboard configuration](/dashboard/configuration/).

For more information about logging into the dashboard, see [Dashboard authentication](/dashboard/explore/#dashboard-authentication).

## Explore the dashboard

The dashboard offers a UI for viewing telemetry. Refer to the documentation to explore the telemetry functionality:

- [Structured logs page](/dashboard/explore/#structured-logs-page)
- [Traces page](/dashboard/explore/#traces-page)
- [Metrics page](/dashboard/explore/#metrics-page)

Although there is no restriction on where the dashboard is run, the dashboard is designed as a development and short-term diagnostic tool. The dashboard persists telemetry in-memory which creates some limitations:

- Telemetry is automatically removed if [telemetry limits](configuration#telemetry-limits) are exceeded.
- No telemetry is persisted when the dashboard is restarted.

### Unavailable features when standalone

The dashboard has functionality for viewing Aspire resources. The dashboard resource features are disabled when it is run in standalone mode. To enable the resources UI, [add configuration for a resource service](/dashboard/configuration/#resources).

[GitHub Copilot functionality](/dashboard/copilot/) isn't available in the standalone dashboard. Copilot uses a connection to your IDE to communicate with GitHub Copilot and that connection isn't available when the dashboard is in standalone mode.

## Send telemetry to the dashboard

Apps send telemetry to the dashboard using [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/). The dashboard must expose a port for receiving OpenTelemetry data, and apps are configured to send data to that address.

A Docker command was shown earlier to [start the dashboard](#start-the-dashboard). It configured the container to receive OpenTelemetry data on port `4317`. The OTLP endpoint's full address is `http://localhost:4317`.

### Configure OpenTelemetry SDK

Apps collect and send telemetry using [their language's OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/).

Important OpenTelemetry SDK options to configure:

- OTLP endpoint, which should match the dashboard's configuration, for example, `http://localhost:4317`.
- OTLP protocol, with the dashboard currently supporting only the [OTLP/gRPC protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlpgrpc). Configure applications to use the `grpc` protocol.

To configure applications:

- Use the OpenTelemetry SDK APIs within the application, or
- Start the app with [known environment variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/#configuration-options):
  - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` with a value of `grpc`.
  - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` with a value of `http://localhost:4317`.
